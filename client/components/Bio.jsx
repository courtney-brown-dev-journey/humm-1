        humm is a community-oriented living centre, designed to provide vulnerable members of our society not just food and shelter, but a range of building blocks they need to recover from addiction and trauma and feel safe and included in the world.

        We see ourselves not as an accommodation facility but as a community, offering residents counselling (individual and group), as well as opportunities to foster their hobbies and talents, and bond with other members of our whƒÅnau through communal meals, movie nights, yoga classes and more fun stuff.
